=head1 CHECKING THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY CALENDAR

=head2 PURPOSE

The  C<calfr> program  may run  in I<dialog>  mode. Actually,  back in
1983-1984,  I  did  not   understand  the  concepts  of  C<stdin>  and
C<stdout>. Since then  I have understood them and I  use them for bulk
testing the conversion program.

=head2 FILES

To  check  the  conversions  from  French  Revolutionary  calendar  to
Gregorian, I use the following files:

=over 4

=item *

F<ent-rep> a series of C<2>  conversion commandes and of dates such as
C<18 2 8> (for 18 Brumaire VIII)

=item *

F<sort-greg-arith>  the  expected  result  of the  conversions,  using
Romme's arithmetic rule.

=item *

F<sort-greg-equi> the  expected result  of the conversions,  using the
astronomical rule with autumn equinoxes.

=back

For the backward conversion from Gregorian to French Revolutionary, I use:

=over 4

=item *

F<ent-greg> a series of C<3>  conversion commands and of dates such as
C<22 9 1792>

=item *

F<sort-rep-arith>  the  expected  result  of the  conversions,  using
Romme's arithmetic rule.

=item *

F<sort-rep-equi> the  expected result  of the conversions,  using the
astronomical rule with autumn equinoxes.

=back

In addition to the date results, the expected output files contain the
prompt messages from the dialog mode.

=head2 ORIGIN

At first, the files will be "hand-typed". Then they will be generated
by the C<gen-tests> program from the L<utility repository|https://github.com/jforget/French-Revolution-calendar-utilities>.
